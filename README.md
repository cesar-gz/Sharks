## React CRUD operations using PHP API and MySQL

I used Apache for the Web Server, AWS RDS for Database Server.

This is a project I'm turning in for my Earth History Lab Final. On the surface its just as website
the history and evolution of Sharks. I added CRUD to it so I can have fun and learn with what was supposed to be just a website I was supposed to create and present.
