      <h4>First Appearance</h4>
      <p>One of the earliest fossil evidence is a few scales from the Late Ordovician Period 450 million years ago.
        There is an argument suggesting that sharks descended from a small leaf-shaped fish that had no eyes, fins or bones. Eventually
        this fish evolved into the two main groups of fish seen today. One of these groups is called the <b style={{ color: '#EDB32B' }}>Chondrichhthyes</b>,
        and they are the cartilaginous fish such as the sharks, rays, and chimaera.

      <h4>Fossilized Devonian Sharks</h4>
      <p>This fossil was found in Canada in 2003, and is dated to be around 400 Million years old. It belongs to the
        shark called <b style={{ color: '#EDB32B' }}>Doliodus Problematicus</b>. The second image shows a different shark
        called the <b style={{ color: '#EDB32B' }}>Cladoselache</b>, and it was found near Lake Erie in Ohio.

      <h4>Oldest Shark tooth</h4>
      <p>This fossil comes from 364 million years ago during the Devonian (the age of the fishes), and it belongs to the the fish called
        <b style={{ color: '#EDB32B' }} > Agelodus Pectinatus</b>. This is from the Red Hill in Pennsylvania.

      <h4>The Golden Age of Sharks was during the Carboniferous Period (359 mya)</h4>
      <p>
        There was a extinction event that allowed sharks to become the dominant ocean predator. The old armored fish predator, placoderms,
        became extinct. This allowed sharks to evolving into various shapes and sizes. Sharks began spreading out to freshwater while others
        stayed in salt water. Teeth variations started to take place based on shark's diets. The shark with its mouth open is the
        <b style={{ color: '#EDB32B' }} > Edestus heinrichi</b>. The shark on the bottom is the <b style={{ color: '#EDB32B' }} >Stethacanthus altonensis</b>.
        The shark in the background is the <b style={{ color: '#EDB32B' }} >Glikmanius occidentalis</b>.

      <h4>Shark Mass Extinction during Permian Period (252 mya)</h4>
      <p>"The Big One" extinction event killed 96% of all marine life. Some specialized sharks became extinct like the spiny sharks.
        One of the sharks during this time was called the <b style={{ color: '#EDB32B' }}>Orthachanthus</b>. This fossil of it was found in
        Germany. This shark is 8 feet long.

      <h4>Mesozoic Shark Recovery (252 mya), to the Early Jurassic Period (195 mya), to the Cretaceous Period (145 mya)</h4>
      <p>
        Earth began to recover from an extinction event, the reptiles dominated the land, air, and oceans. Sharks became the
        lower tier predator and were no longer considered dominant. Nonetheless sharks still grew and diversified. During the Jurassic,
        the oldest modern sharks, <b style={{ color: '#EDB32B' }}> Hexanchiformes</b> aka the sixgill sharks, evolved to have flexible
        protruding jaws. These jaws allowed sharks to eat animals bigger then themselves and to swim faster. At the end of the Mesozoic era,
        another extinction event killed a lot of reptiles allowing Sharks to become the top predators in the ocean. But the extinction event
        also took out a lot of the large sharks.

      <h4>Cenozoic (65 mya), sharks became big again, and came the birth of Megalodon</h4>
      <p>
        Land mammals like whales, dolphins and seals returned to the ocean. This gave sharks a new food source which increased their size.
        This is where the <b style={{ color: '#EDB32B' }} >Otodus Obliquus</b> came to be. This shark eventually gave birth to a new species that is known as the
        <b style={{ color: '#EDB32B' }} > Megalodon</b>. The Megalodon grew in size every year until it finally became extinct in the Miocene (23 mya). The
        Meg could be as big as 60 feet and could weigh up to 105,000 lbs. The Meg is not related to the great white sharks, and it competed with great white sharks for food.
